        <p>
          Gesit, a successful entrepreneur and car enthusiast, and Ammar, a young and ambitious driver, met at the Circuit de
          Spa-Francorchamps in 1995. Gesit was impressed by Ammar's skills behind the wheel and saw an opportunity to sign him as
          a driver for his newly formed racing team. As they talked, Gesit learned that Ammar was not only an exceptional driver
          but also a skilled mechanic and engineer, and he saw the potential for a strong partnership.

          for performance, a commitment to excellence, and a desire to push the boundaries of what was possible. Their partnership
